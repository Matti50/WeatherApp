# WeatherApp
App that displays info about weather in your current location

# What I learned
Small app made to research and learn about React Native and different modules

- React Native Expo CLI gave me the boilerplate to start building the app
- OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data (had to authenticate myself)
- axios for making GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data
- Handling Location permissions with expo-permissions and expo-location dependencies
- Used some React Native basic features and components like Text, Image or View
- Used componentDidMount lifecycle method
- Explored for the first time async/await ES7 functions

# Usage

First, run npm install expo-cli to install the React Native Expo CLI modules
Then, run npm install to install all the dependencies
Finally, run expo start to run the dev mode of the app
